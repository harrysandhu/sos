# SOS 

- we are going to use Pintos : a pretty simple operating system
    - 8086 architecture
    - features
        - kernal threads
        - loading and running programs
        - file system

    - what we wanna do?
        - understand
        - improve its support
        - virtual memory implementation

    
    - WORKS WITH 8086 CPU
        - we dont have that
        - lets simulate that environment

    - hard

    - how to run pintos
        - need an ubuntu machine
