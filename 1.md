# pintos loader and kernel initialization

- threads/loader.S
    - stored in first sector of the hard disk for pc bios to load
    - PC BIOS loads loader --> loader loads kernel at 0x7c00-0x7e00 (512 bytes)
    - and jumps to to entry point - start.S


    - pc bios loads the loader from MBR
    - memory usage
        - 64 bytes - MBR partition table
        - 128 bytes for kernel cmd args
        - ~300 bytes for loader code

    - 300 bytes is tight, therefore we need assembly


## loader.S -> load kernel -> transfer control to start.S


# process

t0 : submitted job 
ti : start exec
tp : output 

t0-----ti=========tp 


waiting time : ti - t0
turnaround time : tp - t0 


- what we need?
    - minimize waiting and turnaround time





JOB    EXEC TIME

J1  --> 15
J2      8
J3      10
J4      3


### FCFS scheduling

- jobs arrived in sequence

- CASE 

0   
|----j1----|----j2----|-----j3----|----j4---|

    15          8           10          3

    Wj1 = 0 : waiting time of j1
    Wj2 = 15
    Wj3 = 23
    Wj4 = 33
    Tw = 71

    AvgWait = 17.75




### SJF scheduling
- lets change the sequence:
- we dont care how they arrive
- we care how they are exec

- put em in the queue


|----j4----|----j2----|-----j3----|----j1---|

     3          8           10         15

    Wj4 = 0 : waiting time of j4
    Wj2 = 3
    Wj3 = 11
    Wj1 = 21
    Tw = 35

    AvgWait = 8.75


- exec shorter jobs first




# process state diagram

single core - runs cant overlap


A ---run---| io           || wait | ------ run ------| .
B wait     | --- run -------------| io          | wait| -- run --|
