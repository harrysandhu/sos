# 8086 assembly


- global keyword :: make identifier accessible to the linker
```
global _start
_start: ; this creates a label, a section of code

```
## regsiters

- eax
    - what system call code
    - accumulator
- ebx
    - base address
    - example in the case of eax 4 , we use ebx 1 to indicate stdout file
- ecx
    - count register
    - bytes to write

- edx
    - data register
    - num of bytes to write


##  Operands
 

```    
mov dest, source
sub dest, source   ; (dest - source)
mov ebx, 123       ; ebx = 123
mov eax, ebx       ; eax = ebx
add ebx, ecx       ; ebx += ecx
sub ebx, edx       ; ebx -= edx
mul ebx            ; eax *= ebx
div edx            ; eax /= edx

int 80h            ; interrupt, systemcall to exit

```


#### eax
   - int 80h means systemcall
   - system call that it makes depends on the value in the eax register
    - eax values for signal calls:
        - http://faculty.nps.edu/cseagle/assembly/sys_call.html


- mul & div are always applied to eax register because its the accumulator register


- db : data byte
- equ : (for symbols) use for assigning single absolute values to symbols

- ecx : bytes to write


## control flow



### instruction pointer
    - internal pointer in the processor
    - EIP
    - location of machine code that the processor is executing
    - processor can jump around different locations in the code, just by changing the value of this pointer
    - not like register
        - you cant change the eip using mov, add, sub
        - changed by jump ops
    - jmp labelname  ---> jump to that label, changes the value of the instruction pointer

### compare
    - cmp
    - example
  ```
   mov ecx, 99
   cmp ecx, 100         ## sets some special bits that we can access later to see the result of this comparision
                       ;  that means, we can check, if ecx was <, >, >= , <= , == than the 100

   jl skip              ; jump to skip if less than    

  ```



# jump conditions:

- jg, jl, je, jge, jne, jle
